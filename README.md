# OldFartsDiscordBot
Bot for Old Farts

# Features
Welcome message
temp voice channels

# Installation 
You need to have python installed and also install pycord

you can do this using pip with the command: 
python3 -m pip install -U py-cord

# setup
The bot requires 2 files containing the ID for your server and the secret token for your bot

Your server ID can be obtained by right clicking your server icon in discord and selecting "copy ID"
This should be saved in a txt file named "serverID.txt"

Your secret bot token is obtained from your discord developer portal when you create a new bot, this token tells the code which discord bot it will be controlling.
Make sure to keep this token a secret, this is why I have written the code to store that information seperately so you wont even need to share it with me. 

Once these 2 files are ready and in the same folder as the python bot just run the bot and it should handle the rest. 

WARNING: you must invite the bot to your server prior to running it or it wont be able to set the server variable and will crash. I will probaby rewrite this in the future.
